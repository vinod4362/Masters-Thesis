Task 4: Write Unit Tests for Existing Code (pytest)
Objective
Given an implementation of a simple text normalizer, write unit tests to achieve meaningful coverage,
including edge cases (empty input, punctuation, mixed case, numbers). Do not modify the implementation file; only add tests.

Expected Output
- A pytest suite with multiple tests covering normal cases and edge cases.
- Demonstrate assertion of both value and type where relevant.
