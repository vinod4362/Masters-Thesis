Task 1: Sorting Algorithm (QuickSort)
Objective
Implement an in-place QuickSort for a list of integers and expose a function quicksort(nums) -> list.

Requirements
- Average-case O(n log n) expected behavior.
- Stable behavior not required; in-place partitioning allowed.
- Must handle edge cases: empty list, single element, duplicates, negative numbers.
- Provide a simple CLI to read a line of space-separated integers from stdin and print the sorted sequence.

Expected Output
Input:  "3 1 4 1 5 9"
Output: "1 1 3 4 5 9"

Evaluation Notes
- Unit tests will validate correctness on random arrays and adversarial distributions.
- Code quality and readability will be scored using the rubric.
