Task 3: Debugging Faulty Code (Python)
Objective
You are given a buggy implementation that should compute the nth Fibonacci number with memoization,
but it contains logical and performance issues. Fix the code so that fib(n) returns correct results for n>=0,
and add minimal input validation.

Expected Output
- fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(10)=55, fib(30)=832040
- Runtime should be near O(n). Avoid exponential recursion.
